# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This project analyzes airline passenger satisfaction data to identify factors influencing customer experience. The analysis revealed that only 43.45% of passengers were satisfied with their flights, with returning customers and business travelers reporting higher satisfaction rates. Passengers on longer flights (averaging 1529 km) tended to be more satisfied than those on shorter journeys (averaging 930 km), with satisfaction levels influenced by key factors including seat comfort, cleanliness, in-flight service, and punctuality. The project includes visualizations examining satisfaction by customer type, travel class, and flight distance. Two machine learning models were implemented, with Random Forest outperforming Logistic Regression in predicting passenger satisfaction. The implementation uses Python with Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for modeling.
